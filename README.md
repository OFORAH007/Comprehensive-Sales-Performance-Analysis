### üìùProject Overview
In today's competitive business landscape, understanding sales performance is crucial for sustainable growth. This project leverages Tableau to visualize and analyze sales data, transforming raw information into clear, interactive dashboards. The analysis covers various aspects of sales, including overall key metrics, customer profitability, product performance, sales by category, and geographical distribution.

### üéØObjectives
The primary objectives of this sales performance analysis are to:
1. Monitor Key Sales Metrics: Track essential performance indicators such as Profit, Profit Ratio, Sales, Order Count, Average Order Value (AOV), and Average Days to Ship.
2. Identify Profitable and Unprofitable Customers: Segment customers based on their profitability to inform targeted marketing and sales strategies.
3. Analyze Sales by Category and Sub-Category: Understand which product categories and sub-categories are driving the most revenue and profit.
4. Assess Geographical Performance: Identify top-performing states/regions and areas with potential for growth or requiring intervention.
5. Evaluate Product Performance: Determine the best-selling and most profitable products.
6. Analyze Revenue by Ship Mode: Understand the impact of different shipping methods on revenue across sub-categories.
7. Examine Order Origin: Gain insights into the percentage of orders by country of manufacture.
8. Provide Actionable Insights: Generate data-driven recommendations to optimize sales strategies, improve profitability, and enhance operational efficiency.

### ‚ÑπÔ∏èData Source
The analysis is based on a sales dataset, typically containing information such as:
- Order Details: Order Date, Ship Date, Order ID
- Product Information: Product ID, Product Name, Category, Sub-Category
- Sales Metrics: Sales, Profit, Quantity
- Customer Information: Customer ID, Customer Name, Segment
- Geographical Data: State, Region, Country

### üßÆMethodology
1. *Data Connection & Preparation*:
- Connected to the raw sales data in Tableau.
- I used unique identifier of each dimension table to establish an inner join with sales fact table.
- Performed necessary data cleaning and transformations (e.g., date formatting, creating calculated fields for profit ratio, AOV, etc.).

2. *Tools Used*:
- Azure SQL Data Studion - For Data Extraction [Download](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure-data-studio/download-azure-data-studio?tabs=win-install%2Cwin-user-install%2Credhat-install%2Cwindows-uninstall%2Credhat-uninstall)
- Microsoft Excel (Power Query) - For cleaning and Data Transformation processes [Download](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/excel)
- Tableau Desktop - Data Visualization [Download](https://www.tableau.com/products/desktop/download)
- Tableau Public - For Proper Publication and documentation [Access](https://public.tableau.com/app/discover)
- Github - Also for documentation [Access](https://github.com/)

2. *Dashboard Design & Development*:
- Created multiple interactive dashboards, each focusing on a specific aspect of sales performance.
- Utilized various chart types (bar charts, line charts, scatter plots, treemaps, maps, pie charts, tables) to effectively visualize the data.
- Implemented filters (e.g., OrderDate, Segment, Top N Sales) to allow for dynamic exploration of the data.
- Ensured a clean, intuitive, and visually appealing layout for easy interpretation.

3. *Analysis and Interpretation*:
- Analyzed trends and patterns within each dashboard.
- Identified key insights related to profitability, top performers, areas for improvement, and potential risks.
- Formulated actionable recommendations based on the data.

  - States by Sales (Map): A choropleth map visualizing sales performance across different states, color-coded by region.
  - Sales by State (Table): A detailed table showing sales figures for each state across different years.
  - Top 10 Product by Sales: A treemap showing the top products by sales, with color representing profitability.
 
3. Revenue by Ship Mode & Sub-Category Dashboard

### üí°Key Insights and Recommendations
1. Customer Profitability Optimization: Conduct a deeper analysis into the characteristics of these unprofitable customers. This could involve examining their purchase history, return rates, discount utilization, or service costs. Develop targeted strategies to either improve their profitability (e.g., through upselling, cross-selling, or reducing service costs) or re-evaluate the viability of serving these segments.
  
2. Geographic Sales Focus: California, New York, and Texas consistently rank as the top states by sales.

- Recommendation: Continue to invest in these high-performing regions to maximize market penetration. Simultaneously, identify states with moderate sales and explore opportunities for growth through targeted marketing campaigns or sales initiatives. The regional breakdown on the map can guide resource allocation.

3. Product Portfolio Management: Technology is the leading sales category, and certain products (e.g., TEC-CO-10004722-1-1, TEC-MA-10001047-2-1) are significant revenue drivers.

- Recommendation: Leverage the success of top-performing products and categories by investing in their continued development and promotion. For products with high sales but low profitability (if any are identified), investigate cost structures or pricing strategies. Conversely, for highly profitable but lower-volume products, explore ways to increase their market visibility and sales.

4. Shipping Mode Efficiency: The "Revenue by Ship Mode & Sub-Category" dashboard reveals how different shipping methods contribute to revenue across various product sub-categories.

- Recommendation: Analyze the preferred shipping modes for high-value or high-volume sub-categories. Optimize logistics and shipping partnerships based on these insights to reduce costs or improve delivery times, thereby enhancing customer satisfaction and potentially increasing sales.

Overall Sales Health & Trends: The key metrics show healthy overall sales and profit ratios, with monthly profit trends indicating seasonality or growth patterns.
